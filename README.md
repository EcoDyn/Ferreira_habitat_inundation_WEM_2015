# Ferreira_habitat_inundation_WEM_2015
Habitat and inundation maps published in Ferreira-Ferreira et al., Wetlands Ecology and Management, 2015.



Processing steps after publication:

1) A new habitat layer was produced by dissolving the original objects used as classification inputs, to reduce file size and complexity.

2) Habitat class information was combined with the inundation duration data, maintaining the original classification objects.  

3) Class names were modified to match names used in publication.

4) The habitat + inundation .shp file has been converted to geodatabase format.

5) QGIS palette layers were included for available shapefiles
